/// This class provides the sequence for psudo-ordering of all events.
/// Each user of the system generates events sequened using this class,
/// As they encounter other users (sharing of projects) the sequence
/// for events includes the time from those other users eo allow convergence
/// of changes over time.  For example if user A creates a project and adds
/// 3 entries, and then shares this with user B then when B adds a 4th entry
/// its sequence will include knowledge that it followed user A's 3rd entry
/// in sequence.  If A in the mean time creates 2 more entries then their
/// sequence will include that they happened after A's 3 entry and before
/// any entries by B.  When these are merged the system can detect the
/// ordering of events and do a proper merge of the changes. Inserts are
/// relatively easy, but when deletes and updates are mixed in it becomes
/// more "interesting" and is generally called a CRDT system.  This class
/// just provides the sequencing that allows the merge.  Merges occurr in
/// aggregators, and sharing of data in event stores.
